# ChatGPT Feedback Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to analyze user feedback on ChatGPT, focusing on sentiment classification to understand user experiences better. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, this analysis provides valuable insights into the sentiment behind user reviews.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in user feedback, including sentiment distribution and rating correlations.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms (such as Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes) to classify reviews into three sentiment categories: Positive, Neutral, and Negative.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes key metrics through charts and graphs to illustrate sentiment trends and user feedback over time.
- **Interactive Sentiment Predictions**: Allows users to input new reviews and receive sentiment predictions along with confidence probabilities.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn)
- Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- TfidfVectorizer for text representation

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the analysis script to explore user feedback and generate insights.

## Future Work
- Improve model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and additional feature engineering.
- Expand the analysis to include topic modeling and sentiment trends over time.
